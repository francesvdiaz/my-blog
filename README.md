# My First Blog
#### By *Frances Ojeda-Diaz*
#### My very first blog!

## Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Description:
For my first blog, I added text that I quickly swapped out for dummy text. I added images that I felt conveyed my feelings as well as some random words and phrases. I added an about me too. This is meant to be a starting point to what I want to do in the future, like add videos, cursor effects and music players.

## Setup/Installation Requirements:
There are no specific requirements besides opening the link and  launching the github page to see the file.

## Known Bugs:
There are currently no known bugs, phew.

## License:
No license, yet! If you have any questions, email me at: vfrances.ww@gmail.com

  I haven't been in therapy for a year now, I still miss my old therapist.
  I think I'm still grieving the safe space I felt I had with her, something I've never had with anyone.
  She saw me at my worst, and never judged me. It was her job, I know, but I felt loved by her.
  I felt seen and cared for.</p>
 <p>It's still tearing me up.</p>
 <h3>Not to cause destruction, or tear us apart,</h4>
 <p>I think I love people the most when we live through something together; when they live through me. 
 Something about knowing someone has chosen to stick around, that is something I would pay any price for.</p>
 <h3>Just to give us something to look at, something that isn't our feet.</h4>

  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  
  <p>The author is someone you know. When you look at them you see someone you long for,
  some part of yourself you know is there yet left to excavate. They seem cool, unbothered,
  but they're really just a mirror. So I am me, I am you. We share the same room.
